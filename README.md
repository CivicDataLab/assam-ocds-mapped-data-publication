### Purpose of Publication
The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) enables organisations to publish contracting process information at all the stages. OCDS defines a standard data model for  publishing contracting process data and documents with the aim of improving transparency and consumability of governmental data
Therefore the importance of implementing OCDS are following
* Promote the transparency in decision making
* Provide data in machine readable formats
* Increase consumption of contracting data across the globe
* Provide ample amount of metadata to understand the contracting data

### OCDS Data Curation
Assam Finance Department publishes purchase and contracting related data on https://assamtenders.gov.in/nicgep/appThis. This  portal includes two stage data tender and awards divided into different categories like tenders in archive, results of tender, tenders by organization. However to start the mapping process, we requested the assam finance department to provide a bulk dump of the last 5 years of contract data. We are in the process of setting up an automated data pipeline to scrape more fields from the etenders platform.
